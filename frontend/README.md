## Components

### Login

`Login.jsx` is the initial page of the application, where users can log in to access the dashboard.

### Dashboard

`Dashboard.jsx` is the main landing page after login. It includes navigation to Home, Analytics, and Settings as well as a Logout button.

### Home

`Home.jsx` lists modules in a grid layout. Each module tile navigates to its respective module page. It includes navigation to the Dashboard and Settings as well as a Logout button.

### Settings

`Settings.jsx` allows users to manage their account settings. It includes navigation to the Dashboard and a Logout button.

### Analytics

`Analytics.jsx` displays analytics data. It includes navigation to the Dashboard and a Logout button.

### ModulePage

`ModulePage.jsx` is a dynamic page that loads content for each module based on the URL parameter. It shows content from specific modules like Module 1, Module 2, etc.

### Module Content Components

- `Module1.jsx`
- `Module2.jsx`
- ...

Each module content component contains specific content for that module.

## Routing

The routes for the application are defined in `App.js` using `react-router-dom`. The main routes are:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Login from './components/Login';
import Home from './components/Home';
import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';
import ModulePage from './components/ModulePage';
import Settings from './components/Settings';
import Analytics from './components/Analytics';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Login />} />
        <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
        <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/module/:moduleName" element={<ModulePage />} />
        <Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />
        <Route path="/analytics" element={<Analytics />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
